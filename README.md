## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, Zustand (State Management), Framer Motion, Lucide React.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.
- **Data Storage**: Local JSON files.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AsleepX/zeader-rss.git
   cd rss-reader
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

Start both the backend server and the frontend development server with a single command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend API runs on `http://localhost:3001`

## Deployment

### Deploy to Server

To deploy Zeader on a server, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository** on your server:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AsleepX/zeader-rss.git
    cd rss-reader
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Build the frontend**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

4.  **Start the server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will start on port 3001 by default. You can access the application at `http://your-server-ip:3001`.

    > **Note**: In production, the backend server (port 3001) serves the built frontend files. This is different from development mode where Vite uses port 5173.

    *Optional*: You can set the `PORT` and `PASSWORD` environment variables to customize the port and enable password protection.
    ```bash
    export PORT=8080
    export PASSWORD=your_secure_password
    npm start
    ```
